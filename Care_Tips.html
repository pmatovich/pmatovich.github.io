	  <br><br>Whether you're a new cat owner, or a certified purrfessional, we could all use some helpful tips and tricks to better our pet care! Our Care Tips provide you with a series of generally helpful information for how to handle your furry friend's basic care needs. From feeding, to grooming, health, play, and training, Care Tips covers it all! Below you'll find sectioned information, read it all to gain some general knowledge, or scroll to find whichever section is most relevant to you and your pets! <br><br><br><br> <b><h1>Feeding: How Often Should I Feed My Cat? </h1></b>Kittens require more food per pound of body weight to support their growth than do adult cats, and therefore should be fed more often throughout the day. "Growing kittens up to six months of age may require three meals a day," says Francis Kallfelz, DVM, Ph.D., board certified by the American College of Veterinary Nutrition and James Law professor of nutrition at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. "From age six months to maturity, most cats will do well when fed two times a day."<br><br>

	  Once the cat becomes an adult, at about one year, feeding once or twice a day is appropriate in most cases. Senior cats, age seven and above, should maintain the same feeding regimen. "Once cats reach adulthood, once a day feeding is fine as long as they are healthy and have no disease problems suggesting a reason to feed differently," says Dr. Kallfelz. <br><br> <b><h1>Grooming: How Often Should I Brush My Cat?</h1></b>Cats need regular brushing to keep their coats looking tidy, especially if they have long fur. Brushing also helps remove dirt and tangles while spreading healthy oils throughout their coat, keeping their skin and fur healthy and getting rid of irritation. Cats with short hair only need to be brushed once weekly, long-haired cats need a little more care and should be brushed daily. <br><br> <b><h1>Health: How Often Should I Take My Cat to the Vet?</h1></b> Adult cats should see the vet at least once a year for a check-up, dental cleanings and vaccinations. Cats hide pain and discomfort well, so it often takes the trained eye of a vet to see when something’s wrong.

	  There’s a common misconception that indoor cats aren’t exposed to any dangers and don’t need these shots. However, all cats need regular rabies and distemper vaccines. In some cases, these shots are good for up to three years. In this case, your vet can simply test your cat’s immunity level to make sure he or she is protected. <br><br> <b><h1>Play: How Long/Often Should I Play With My Cat?</h1></b> There's no exact amount of exercise your cat should be getting every day, but generally speaking at least two sessions of playtime a day of around 15-20 minutes each should help to keep them active. If you're playing with your cat and they've had enough, they're likely to just stop playing or even walk off. <br><br></div>
